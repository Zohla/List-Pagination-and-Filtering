<h2>List Pagination and Filtering</h2>
<p> A program that paginates through a list using pagination links. </p>
<p>The links/buttons are made in JS, but the list is found in the .html</p>
<p>Currently set to show 10 list items per page, but the code is dynamic, so this number can be changed.</p>

<p>It has a search function that lets you dynamicly search for items in the list and hides item that doesn't match the search.
It also has an error message pop up if there are no matches</p>
